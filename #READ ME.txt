Part way through making a smoother way to change the modalities.
For the time being, you need to turn on the player character you want in each scene

just VR and Speech Rec is called Enhanced Player - VR,SR

Words of warning, some diorama scenes might take you to the wrong scene. 
had to reorder the build index and havent given the exhibits the right index to take them to the right one yet.

Careful when going into the diorama scenes with VR, they havent got a minimum distance before the gesture activates yet,
you might end up getting sucked in if your go the the exhibit with your hands too far apart.
