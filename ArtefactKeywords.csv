It was revived during the Personal Rule of Charles I as a general tax that applied to all cities and counties, not just coastal ones."
Ship Money,PickUp Artefacts,Charles I,Why,"As there were no Parliaments during the Personal Rule, Charles I couldn't request money from Parliament so he began to levy Ship Money again. The first of six annual writs appeared in October 1634 and differed from traditional levies in that it was based on the possibility of war rather than immediate national emergency. The writ of the following year increased the imposition and extended it to inland towns. The issue of a third writ in 1636 made it evident that Charles intended ship money as a permanent and general form of taxation."

Ship Money,PickUp Artefacts,Charles I,John Hampden,"Hampden was one such opponent of Ship Money. By the third writ, he refused to pay the money. In 1635 Hampden refused to pay 20 shillings in ship money, and the case went before the 12 judges of the Court of the Exchequer.

"Parliaments of Charles I, Pre Personal Rule",Diorama,Charles I,First Parliament,"When his first Parliament met in June 1625, trouble immediately arose because of the general distrust of Buckingham, who had retained his ascendancy over the new king. The Spanish war was proving a failure and Charles offered Parliament no explanations of his foreign policy. Antagonism soon arose between the new king and the Commons, and Parliament refused to vote him the right to levy tonnage and poundage (customs duties) except on conditions that increased its powers, though this right had been granted to previous monarchs for life."
"Parliaments of Charles I, Pre Personal Rule",Diorama,Charles I,Second Parliament,"The second Parliament of the reign, meeting in February 1626, proved even more critical of the king’s government, though some of the former leaders of the Commons were kept away because Charles had ingeniously appointed them sheriffs in their counties. The failure of a naval expedition against the Spanish port of Cádiz was blamed on Buckingham and the Commons tried to impeach him for treason. To prevent this, Charles dissolved Parliament in June."
"Parliaments of Charles I, Pre Personal Rule",Diorama,Charles I,Third Parliament,"By the time Charles’s third Parliament met (March 1628), Buckingham’s expedition to aid the French Protestants at La Rochelle had been decisively repelled and the king’s government was thoroughly discredited. The House of Commons at once passed resolutions condemning arbitrary taxation and arbitrary imprisonment and then set out its complaints in the Petition of Right, which sought recognition of four principles—no taxes without consent of Parliament; no imprisonment without cause; no quartering of soldiers on subjects; no martial law in peacetime. The king, despite his efforts to avoid approving this petition, was compelled to give his formal consent."
"Parliaments of Charles I, Pre Personal Rule",Diorama,Charles I,Fourth Parliament,"By the time the fourth Parliament met in January 1629, Buckingham had been assassinated. The House of Commons now objected both to what it called the revival of “popish practices” in the churches and to the levying of tonnage and poundage by the king’s officers without its consent. The king ordered the adjournment of Parliament on March 2, 1629, but before that the speaker was held down in his chair and three resolutions were passed condemning the king’s conduct. Charles realized that such behaviour was revolutionary. For the next 11 years he ruled his kingdom without calling a Parliament."
"Parliaments of Charles I, Post Personal Rule",Diorama,Charles I,The Short Parliament,"Charles summoned a Parliament that met in April 1640—later known as the Short Parliament—in order to raise money for the war against Scotland. The House insisted first on discussing grievances against the government and showed itself opposed to a renewal of the war; so, on May 5, the king dissolved Parliament again. The collection of ship money was continued and so was the war."
"Parliaments of Charles I, Post Personal Rule",Diorama,Charles I,The Long Parliament,"The Long Parliament proved much more Uncompromising than the Short. During its first nine months it brought down the king’s advisers, swept away the machinery of conciliar government developed by the Tudors and early Stuarts, made frequent sessions of Parliament a statutory necessity, and passed an act forbidding its own dissolution without its members’ consent. Tension between the king and Parliament steadily increased, notably upon Charles’ abortive attempt to arrest five of its members in January 1642, and the Civil Wars broke out later that year. "
"Parliaments of Charles I, Post Personal Rule",Diorama,Charles I,The Bishops Wars,"Bishops’ Wars, (1639 and 1640) were two brief campaigns that were fought between Charles I and the Scots. The wars were the result of Charles’s endeavour to enforce Anglican observances in the Scottish Church and of the determination of the Scots to abolish episcopacy.Lacking sufficient funds and lacking confidence in his troops Charles agreed, by the Pacification of Berwick, to leave the Scots alone. The first Bishops’ War thus ended without battle. Charles would recall Parliament after 11 years to raise money for a campaign against the Scots but would later dissolve the Parliament after 3 weeks and conduct the expedition himself.The subsequent military successes of the Scots in the second Bishops’ War and their seizure of the whole of Northumberland and Durham made it necessary for Charles to summon the Long Parliament."
"Parliaments of Charles I, Post Personal Rule",Diorama,Charles I,Relationship,"From the beginning of his reign, Charles I demonstrated a distrust of the House of Commons. Parliament was critical of his government, condemning his policies of arbitrary taxation and imprisonment. On several occasions, Charles I dissolved Parliament without its consent. In 1641 Parliament presented to Charles I the Grand Remonstrance, listing grievances against the king."
The Personal Rule,Diorama,Charles I,What?,"The Personal Rule was an 11 year period during Charle's rule where he ruled by decree. His enemies called this period the ""Eleven Year Tyranny""."
The Personal Rule,Diorama,Charles I,Why,"As Charles conflicted with Parliament frequently, he decided that would rule without Parliament, at least until they were more willing to defer to him and ""understand him"". From the outside, England appeared to be peaceful during this period, but many problems were present but did not come to the surface, such as Charles' dubious financial methods and Church reforms."
The Personal Rule,Diorama,Charles I,Ireland,"Thomas Wentworth became Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1633 and had many aims he wanted to achieve. These include: making Ireland financially self-suffcient, enforce religious conformity as defiend his William Laud, to ""civilise"" the Irish and to ,in general, extend Royal Control. These actions alienated both Protestants and Catholics in Ireland."
The Personal Rule,Diorama,Charles I,Scotland,"In Scotland, Charles' introduction of a modified version of the ""Book of Common Prayer"" provoked riots across Scotland, starting at St. Giles Church in Edinburgh.

The Execution of Charles I,Diorama,Charles I,Man of Blood,"Following the Royalist defeat, Charles was initially going to remain king, but after attempting to war with Parliament again, he was denounced as a ""Man of Blood"". Charles I was charged with high treason and “other high crimes against the realm of England.” He at once refused to recognize the legality of the court because “a king cannot be tried by any superior jurisdiction on earth.” He therefore refused to plead but maintained that he stood for “the liberty of the people of England.” The sentence of death was read on January 27; his execution was ordered as a tyrant, traitor, murderer, and public enemy.  "
The Execution of Charles I,Diorama,Charles I,Aftermath,"Post Regicide, there was an Interregum,a period of rule without a King. Between 1649 and 1653, England was ruled as a Commonwealth by the Rump Parliament. The Rump Parliament consisted of those who remained after Charle's supporters were removed from their offices. However, the Rump Parliament was not stable and Oliver Cromwell ruled as the first Lord Protector of the Protectorate of England until 1658, where his son, Richard would take over for 8 months for be abdicating."
