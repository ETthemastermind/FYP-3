#==============Charles I Portrait#================ https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-I-king-of-Great-Britain-and-Ireland  http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/stuart_2.htm
Charles believed absolutely in the Diving Right of Kings and this caused many issues between him and his parliaments. In once instance, he dissolved Parliament when they attempted to impeach his favourite, and friend, the Duke of Buckingham.  Disagreement with Parliament resumed when the speaker refused to put forward three resolutions hostile to the King and was forcibly held in his seat while a vote was passed. Charles threatened to send in troops and dissolved Parliament for eleven years from 1629-1640.
From 1629 – 1640, Charles ruled without calling Parliament. This period was known as the “Personal Rule”. Charles didn’t intend to never call a Parliament again but would once Parliament understood him. Eventually, Charles would run out of money and would be forced to call a Parliament, it would be given the name “the Long Parliament” in 1640 and they would go back to fighting each other. 
At last, Charles felt that Parliament went to far when their grievances where presented to him in the “Grand Remonstrance”. Charles would then have the five members impeached and attempted to arrest them for high treason, but they were gone when he arrived at Parliament. He would flee London and raise the Royalist standard at Nottingham, marking the outbreak of the English Civil war, lasting from 1642 – 1646.
After Charles surrendered to the Parliamentarians in 1646, they initially offered allow Charles to remain King but with a written constitution. However, Charles was incredibly stubborn and refused to surrender his Divine right of Kings ideology. He would later escape and then recruit the Scottish to fight the parliamentarians. This was known as the second English civil war. This led to Charles being labelled a “man of blood” and he would stand trial for crimes against the people of England. The outcome of the trial would be his execution. In January 1649, he would be executed by beheading outside the banqueting hall at Whitehall. His execution led to England becoming a republic.
#==== Henrietta Maria Portrait #=======================https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Maria_of_France
This is Henrietta Maria of France. Daughter of Henry IV of France and Marie de Medici, his second wife, and was later wife to Charles I of England. She was born in 25th November 1609, at the Palais du Louvre.
She was described by Sophia of Hanover as a short woman perched on her chair, with long bony arms, irregular shoulders and teeth protruding from her mouth like a fence" but also had beautiful eyes, a well shaped nosed and an admirable complexion".
Henrietta Maria was not popular in England, largely to her being a Catholic queen in a Protestant country. She and Charles argued a lot and he sent her expensive Catholic retinue home, leaving her feeling home sick and neglected. Life would improve once the Duke of Buckingham, Charles' favourite, was assinated and his attention towards him was directed at her. She helped Charles and the Royalist war effort, activley seeking funds and support on the continent and rejoing Charles in 1643. She fled to france in 1644, after the collapse of the Royalist cause, and was exiled there with her remaining children.
 She returned to England, following the restoration of the Monarchy, and lived at Somerset House and recieved money from Parliament and Charles II to live. She returned to France in 1665, following declining health, and founded a convent at Chaillot. She died on 10th September 1669 at the Chateau de Colombes.
#=======================# Mary #========================
This is Mary Stuart, eldest daughter of Charles I and Henrietta Maria. She was born on the 4th November 1631 at St. James Place in London.
Charles I designated his daughter Princess Royal in 1642, thereby establishing the tradition that the eldest daughter of the Sovereign would bear this title. The idea came into being when his French Queen Henrietta Maria, the daughter of King Henry IV of France and Marie de Medici, wanted to imitate the way the eldest daughter of the French king was styled Madame Royale.
On May 2nd 1641, the 9 year old Mary Stuart would marry the 15 year old Prince Willem of Orange. Their marriage would not last long, Willem would die of small pox in 1650, leavingf Mary a widow at the age of 19. Their only child, Willem, would be born a few days later and would go on to be King William III of England, following the abdication of his Uncle James.
Following the restoration of brother, Charles, to the crown, she would return to England in September 1660. However, she would go on contract small pox, with the treatment of bleeding on making her worse. She would die on Christmas eve 1660 at the age of 29.

This is Charles Stuart, the eldest surviving son of Charles I and Henrietta Maria. He was born on the 29th May 1630 and replaced his older brother, Charles James, who died shortly after birth.
Charles' appearance was anything but English, with his sensuous curling mouth, dark complexion, black hair and dark brown eyes, he much resembled his Italian maternal grandmother, Marie de Medici. 
After the execution of his father, Charles allied himself with the Scottish and attacked England, before they were attacked. He was beaten in the short Battle of Worcester in 1651 and was forced to flee. He spent 6 weeks as a fugitive in England. To avoid capture, he cut his hair short, wore leather breeches, a felt hat and faked a country accent. He once spent a day hiding in an oak tree at Boscobel House, whilst Parliamentarian supporters searched the area. 
Charles fled to the continent by ship, pretending to be a merchant escaping debts. The ship's captain ,Nicholas Tattershall, was unaware of Charles' identity. Charles spent the next nine years nomadically moving around Europe with no aim in particular, which made him more cynical and watchful. He would return and be crowned as Charles II in 1660.
#========================# James II Young=============================================== https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Charles_I_and_James_II.png/1920px-Charles_I_and_James_II.png
This is James Stuart, the second surviving son of Charles I and Henrietta Maria. He was born October 14 1633 at St. James Palace in London.
During the war, James and the rest of the Royal Family were in Oxford. When Oxford fell, he was the only royal who had not left. He was taken to St. James Palace and escaped to the Netherlands in 1648.
James went into exile to France with the rest of his family. He devoted himself to the art of war and joined the French Army, under the command of General Turenne. James and Charles were expelled from the French court, once Charles entered into an alliance with Spain in 1656. He would then change sides and fight for the Spanish against the French at the Battle of the Dunes in 1658. 
James would return to England with his brother and would be named as Charles' successor. He would become King James II and VII of England and Scotland when Charles died in 1685.

#============# Ship Tax #===================================================
Ships such as these were subject to the "Ship Money" tax. The tax was originally paid in medieval times on coastal cities and counties for naval defense in time of War. It was revived during the Personal Rule of Charles I as a general tax that applied to all cities and counties, not just coastal ones.
As there were no Parliaments during the Personal Rule, Charles I couldn't request money from Parliament so he began to levy Ship Money again. The first of six annual writs appeared in October 1634 and differed from traditional levies in that it was based on the possibility of war rather than immediate national emergency. The writ of the following year increased the imposition and extended it to inland towns. The issue of a third writ in 1636 made it evident that Charles intended ship money as a permanent and general form of taxation.
With each additional writ, there was more and more oposition to Charles I. Ship Money was one of the many issues that lead to the outbreak of Civil War. Unlike other methods of making money, Ship money wasn't a tax and ,therefore, Charles did not need the consent of Parliament to collect it. 
Hampden was one such opponent of Ship Money. By the third writ, he refused to pay the money. In 1635 Hampden refused to pay 20 shillings in ship money, and the case went before the 12 judges of the Court of the Exchequer. Although seven of the judges upheld Charles and five sided with Hampden, the narrow majority received by the king may have been a factor that encouraged widespread resistance to the tax.

After his failure of his campaign against the Spanish in Cadiz in 1626, Parliament attempted to have Buckingham impeached, but Charles dissolved Parliament rather than let his friend be expelled. Parliament would then attempt to remove Buckingham again, but Charles would not allow it.
