#==============Charles I Portrait#================ https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-I-king-of-Great-Britain-and-Ireland  http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/stuart_2.htm
Charles believed absolutely in the Divine Right of Kings and this caused many issues between him and his parliaments. In once instance, he dissolved Parliament when they attempted to impeach his favourite, and his friend, the Duke of Buckingham.  Disagreement with Parliament resumed when the speaker refused to put forward three resolutions hostile to the King and was forcibly held in his seat while a vote was passed. Charles threatened to send in troops and dissolved Parliament for eleven years from 1629-1640.
From 1629 – 1640, Charles ruled without calling Parliament. This period was known as the “Personal Rule”. Charles didn’t intend to never call a Parliament again but would once Parliament understood him. Eventually, Charles would run out of money and would be forced to call a Parliament, it would be given the name “the Long Parliament” in 1640 and they would go back to fighting each other. 
At last, Charles felt that Parliament went to far when their grievances where presented to him in the “Grand Remonstrance”. Charles would then have the five members impeached and attempted to arrest them for high treason, but they were gone when he arrived at Parliament. He would flee London and raise the Royalist standard at Nottingham, marking the outbreak of the English Civil war, lasting from 1642 – 1646.
After Charles surrendered to the Parliamentarians in 1646, they initially offered allow Charles to remain King but with a written constitution. However, Charles was incredibly stubborn and refused to surrender his Divine right of Kings ideology. He would later escape and then recruit the Scottish to fight the parliamentarians. This was known as the second English civil war. This led to Charles being labelled a “man of blood” and he would stand trial for crimes against the people of England. The outcome of the trial would be his execution. In January 1649, he would be executed by beheading outside the banqueting hall at Whitehall. His execution led to England becoming a republic.
#==== Henrietta Maria Portrait #=======================https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Maria_of_France
This is Henrietta Maria of France. Daughter of Henry IV of France and Marie de Medici, his second wife, and was later wife to Charles I of England. She was born in 25th November 1609, at the Palais du Louvre.
She was described by Sophia of Hanover as a short woman perched on her chair, with long bony arms, irregular shoulders and teeth protruding from her mouth like a fence" but also had beautiful eyes, a well shaped nosed and an admirable complexion".
Henrietta Maria was not popular in England, largely to her being a Catholic queen in a Protestant country. She and Charles argued a lot and he sent her expensive Catholic retinue home, leaving her feeling home sick and neglected. Life would improve once the Duke of Buckingham, Charles' favourite, was assinated and his attention towards him was directed at her. She helped Charles and the Royalist war effort, activley seeking funds and support on the continent and rejoing Charles in 1643. She fled to france in 1644, after the collapse of the Royalist cause, and was exiled there with her remaining children.
 She returned to England, following the restoration of the Monarchy, and lived at Somerset House and recieved money from Parliament and Charles II to live. She returned to France in 1665, following declining health, and founded a convent at Chaillot. She died on 10th September 1669 at the Chateau de Colombes.
#=======================# Mary #========================
This is Mary Stuart, eldest daughter of Charles I and Henrietta Maria. She was born on the 4th November 1631 at St. James Palace in London.
Charles I designated his daughter Princess Royal in 1642, thereby establishing the tradition that the eldest daughter of the Sovereign would bear this title. The idea came into being when his French Queen Henrietta Maria, the daughter of King Henry IV of France and Marie de Medici, wanted to imitate the way the eldest daughter of the French king was styled Madame Royale.
On May 2nd 1641, the 9 year old Mary Stuart would marry the 15 year old Prince Willem of Orange. Willem would die of small pox in 1650, leaving Mary a widow at the age of 19. Their only child, Willem, would be born a few days later and would go on to be King William III of England, following the abdication of his Uncle James.
Following the restoration of her brother, Charles, to the crown, she would return to England in September 1660. However, she would go on contract small pox, with the treatment of bleeding only making her worse. She would die on Christmas eve 1660 at the age of 29.
#=======================#  Charles II Young #=================================  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_England#/media/File:William_Dobson_-_Charles_II,_1630_-_1685._King_of_Scots_1649_-_1685._King_of_England_and_Ireland_1660_-_1685_(When_Prince_of_Wales,_with_a_page)_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg
This is Charles Stuart, the eldest surviving son of Charles I and Henrietta Maria. He was born on the 29th May 1630 and replaced his older brother, Charles James, who died shortly after birth.
Charles' appearance was anything but English, with his sensuous curling mouth, dark complexion, black hair and dark brown eyes, he much resembled his Italian maternal grandmother, Marie de Medici. 
After the execution of his father, Charles allied himself with the Scottish and attacked England, before they were attacked. He was beaten in the short Battle of Worcester in 1651 and was forced to flee. He spent 6 weeks as a fugitive in England. To avoid capture, he cut his hair short, wore leather breeches, a felt hat and faked a country accent. He once spent a day hiding in an oak tree at Boscobel House, whilst Parliamentarian supporters searched the area. 
Charles fled to the continent by ship, pretending to be a merchant escaping debts. The ship's captain ,Nicholas Tattershall, was unaware of Charles' identity. Charles spent the next nine years nomadically moving around Europe with no aim in particular, which made him more cynical and watchful. He would return and be crowned as Charles II in 1660.
#========================# James II Young=============================================== https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Charles_I_and_James_II.png/1920px-Charles_I_and_James_II.png
This is James Stuart, the second surviving son of Charles I and Henrietta Maria. He was born October 14 1633 at St. James Palace in London.
During the war, James and the rest of the Royal Family were in Oxford. When Oxford fell, he was the only royal who had not left. He was taken to St. James Palace and escaped to the Netherlands in 1648.
James went into exile to France with the rest of his family. He devoted himself to the art of war and joined the French Army, under the command of General Turenne. James and Charles were expelled from the French court, once Charles entered into an alliance with Spain in 1656. He would then change sides and fight for the Spanish against the French at the Battle of the Dunes in 1658. 
James would return to England with his brother and would be named as Charles' successor. He would become King James II and VII of England and Scotland when Charles died in 1685.
#============================# Royalist Banner #============================================================== https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/252764597816039311/?lp=true
What - This is a banner, symbolising Charles I and the Royalist Cause.
Royalists - the Royalists championed the divine right of the monarch to govern England and fought against the opposing Parliamentarians. They had a deep-seated loyalty to the monarch and to the protection of King Charles I. Gentry, noblemen and Catholics were staunch supporters of the monarch, as were those who lived in the countryside, particularly the less economically developed northern and westerns parts of England.  
War - The first English civil war began in in 1642 and end in 1646, being followed shortly by the second and third English civil wars from 1648 - 1651. The outcome of the second Civil War was the execution of Charles I. The goal of the third English Civil War was to restore Charles's son, Charles, to the throne but this was a failure. The key battles of the Civil War were: The Battle of Edgehill (1642), The Battle of Newbury (1643), The Battle of Marston Moor (1644) and the Battle of Naseby(1645) which saw the final defeat of the Royalist Cause
Chevalier - The Parliamentarians referred to them as Cavaliers taken from the French word chevalier meaning horseman, the derogatory term was later adopted by the Royalists themselves.
#==================# Flintlock #====================================================
What - This is a Flintlock Pistol, one of two types of Musket. Weapons such as these were commonly used throughout the English Civil War
Use - This pistol saw extensive use during the 17th Century. It is most famous for its use by the Royalist and Parliamentarian cavalry of the English Civil War.
Reliabilty - Both muskets were dangerous and clumsy to use. Some of the longer muskets needed a rest to balance the barrel on because they were too heavy to hold. They were impossible to reload quickly and were most effective when a group of musketeers fired a volley of shots at the enemy.
Alternatives - Other commonly used weapons were the mortar, the cannon, the matchlock and the pike.
#===========# C1 Execution #============================================
What - This is a depiction of the execution of Charles, outside the Banqueting Hall of Whitehall on the 30th of January, 1649.
Regicide - Regicide is the act of killing a king. There were a total of 59 "Regicides" of signed the Death Warrant of Charles I, including Oliver Cromwell, who would later go on to rule England as the first Lord Protector.
Man of Blood - Execution intially was not punishment for Charles, following the Royalist defeat. They were going to allow him to remain King, but after attempting to war with Parliament again, he was denounced as a "Man of Blood". Charles I was charged with high treason and “other high crimes against the realm of England.” He at once refused to recognize the legality of the court because “a king cannot be tried by any superior jurisdiction on earth.” He therefore refused to plead but maintained that he stood for “the liberty of the people of England.” The sentence of death was read on January 27; his execution was ordered as a tyrant, traitor, murderer, and public enemy. 
Aftermath - Post Regicide, there was an Interregum,a period of rule without a King. Between 1649 and 1653, England was ruled as a Commonwealth by the Rump Parliament. The Rump Parliament consisted of those who remained after Charle's supporters were removed from their offices. However, the Rump Parliament was not stable and Oliver Cromwell ruled as the first Lord Protector of the Protectorate of England until 1658, where his son, Richard would take over for 8 months for be abdicating.
#============# Ship Tax #===================================================
Ships such as these were subject to the "Ship Money" tax. The tax was originally paid in medieval times on coastal cities and counties for naval defense in time of War. It was revived during the Personal Rule of Charles I as a general tax that applied to all cities and counties, not just coastal ones.
As there were no Parliaments during the Personal Rule, Charles I couldn't request money from Parliament so he began to levy Ship Money again. The first of six annual writs appeared in October 1634 and differed from traditional levies in that it was based on the possibility of war rather than immediate national emergency. The writ of the following year increased the imposition and extended it to inland towns. The issue of a third writ in 1636 made it evident that Charles intended ship money as a permanent and general form of taxation.
With each additional writ, there was more and more oposition to Charles I. Ship Money was one of the many issues that lead to the outbreak of Civil War. Unlike other methods of making money, Ship money wasn't a tax and ,therefore, Charles did not need the consent of Parliament to collect it. 
Hampden was one such opponent of Ship Money. By the third writ, he refused to pay the money. In 1635 Hampden refused to pay 20 shillings in ship money, and the case went before the 12 judges of the Court of the Exchequer. Although seven of the judges upheld Charles and five sided with Hampden, the narrow majority received by the king may have been a factor that encouraged widespread resistance to the tax.
#==============# Personal Rule #===========================================
What - The Personal Rule was an 11 year period during Charle's rule where he ruled by decree. His enemies called this period the "Eleven Year Tyranny".
Why - As Charles conflicted with Parliament frequently, he decided that would rule without Parliament, at least until they were more willing to defer to him and "understand him". From the outside, England appeared to be peaceful during this period, but many problems were present but did not come to the surface, such as Charles' dubious financial methods and Church reforms.
Ireland - Thomas Wentworth became Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1633, with the aim to Ireland financially self-suffcient, enforce religious conformity as defiend his William Laud, to "civilise" the Irish and to generally extend Royal Control. These actions alienated both Protestants and Catholics in Ireland.
Scotland - In Scotland, Charles' introduction of a modified version of the "Book of Common Prayer" provoked riots across Scotland, starting at St. Giles Church in Edinburgh. The reason for the revolt was due to the Scottish feeling that Charles was interfetting in their Church through the enforcement of Anglican Observances. These riots lead to the First Bishops War.
#============# Buckingham Death #==========================================
What - This is a pamphlet, detailing the assassination of George Villiers, The Duke of Buckingham and favourite of Charles I and his Father, James I
Assassination - Buckingham was assassinated in a pub in Portsmouth by John Felton, a disgruntled Army officer, who believed that his death was for the good of the Country. Felton would later be executed for his murder.
Parliament Reaction - Buckingham was a huge source of contention between Charles and his Parliaments. After his failure of his campaign against the Spanish in Cadiz in 1626, Parliament attempted to have Buckingham impeached, but Charles dissolved Parliament rather than let his friend be expelled. Parliament would then attempt to remove Buckingham again, but Charles would not allow it.
Charles Reaction - Whilst the rest of the country rejoiced at Buckingham's death, Charles mourned the lost of his close friend. Buckingham would be buried in Westminster Abbey, next to James I. Buckingham's first son would be brought up alongisde Charles I's son, the future Charles II and would have an active role in the reign of Charles II.
#===========# Parliaments Pre PR #=========================================
First Parliament - When his first Parliament met in June 1625, trouble immediately arose because of the general distrust of Buckingham, who had retained his ascendancy over the new king. The Spanish war was proving a failure and Charles offered Parliament no explanations of his foreign policy. Antagonism soon arose between the new king and the Commons, and Parliament refused to vote him the right to levy tonnage and poundage (customs duties) except on conditions that increased its powers, though this right had been granted to previous monarchs for life.
Second Parliament - The second Parliament of the reign, meeting in February 1626, proved even more critical of the king’s government, though some of the former leaders of the Commons were kept away because Charles had ingeniously appointed them sheriffs in their counties. The failure of a naval expedition against the Spanish port of Cádiz was blamed on Buckingham and the Commons tried to impeach him for treason. To prevent this, Charles dissolved Parliament in June.
Third Parliament - By the time Charles’s third Parliament met (March 1628), Buckingham’s expedition to aid the French Protestants at La Rochelle had been decisively repelled and the king’s government was thoroughly discredited. The House of Commons at once passed resolutions condemning arbitrary taxation and arbitrary imprisonment and then set out its complaints in the Petition of Right, which sought recognition of four principles—no taxes without consent of Parliament; no imprisonment without cause; no quartering of soldiers on subjects; no martial law in peacetime. The king, despite his efforts to avoid approving this petition, was compelled to give his formal consent.
Fourth Parliament - By the time the fourth Parliament met in January 1629, Buckingham had been assassinated. The House of Commons now objected both to what it called the revival of “popish practices” in the churches and to the levying of tonnage and poundage by the king’s officers without its consent. The king ordered the adjournment of Parliament on March 2, 1629, but before that the speaker was held down in his chair and three resolutions were passed condemning the king’s conduct. Charles realized that such behaviour was revolutionary. For the next 11 years he ruled his kingdom without calling a Parliament.
#===========# Parliaments Post PR #=========================================
The Short Parliament - Charles summoned a Parliament that met in April 1640—later known as the Short Parliament—in order to raise money for the war against Scotland. The House insisted first on discussing grievances against the government and showed itself opposed to a renewal of the war; so, on May 5, the king dissolved Parliament again. The collection of ship money was continued and so was the war.
The Long Parliament - The Long Parliament proved much more Uncompromising than the Short, however. During its first nine months it brought down the king’s advisers, swept away the machinery of conciliar government developed by the Tudors and early Stuarts, made frequent sessions of Parliament a statutory necessity, and passed an act forbidding its own dissolution without its members’ consent. Tension between the king and Parliament steadily increased, notably upon Charles’ abortive attempt to arrest five of its members in January 1642, and the Civil Wars broke out later that year. 
The Bishops Wars - Bishops’ Wars, (1639, 1640) were two brief campaigns that were fought between Charles I and the Scots. The wars were the result of Charles’s endeavour to enforce Anglican observances in the Scottish Church and of the determination of the Scots to abolish episcopacy.Lacking sufficient funds and lacking confidence in his troops, however, Charles agreed, by the Pacification of Berwick, to leave the Scots alone. The first Bishops’ War thus ended without battle. Charles would recall Parliament after 11 years to raise money for a campaign against the Scots but would later dissolve the Parliament after 3 weeks and conduct the expedition himself.The subsequent military successes of the Scots in the second Bishops’ War and their seizure of the whole of Northumberland and Durham made it necessary for Charles to summon the Long Parliament.
Relationship - From the beginning of his reign, Charles I demonstrated a distrust of the House of Commons. Parliament was critical of his government, condemning his policies of arbitrary taxation and imprisonment. On several occasions, Charles I dissolved Parliament without its consent. In 1641 Parliament presented to Charles I the Grand Remonstrance, listing grievances against the king.
#===============#Triennial Act #==============================================
What - This is the Triennial Act, which required Charles to call Parliament at least once every 3 years, for at least 50 days.
When -  The first iteration of the Triennial Act was introduced in 1641, during the Long Parliament of Charles I.
Why - The Triennial Act was introduced in order to curb the prerogatives of the crown in summoining and retaining Parliaments.
Reasoning - The Triennial Act was Parliamentary reform and one key reason why it was introduced was to ensure that another Personal Rule could not happen again. 
#======================# 19 Propositions #==========================================
What - The Ninteen Propostions were a set of proposals for a treaty, that were presented to Charles by the Long Parliament.
When - The Propositions were presented in 1642, after Charles had fled London but before the outbreak of the Civil War.
Goal - The Propositions included deamnds that no ministers should be apporved with Parliamentary approval, Parliament should take control of the army and the future of the Church should be decided by Parliament
Charles' Response - Charles outright refused the Propositions and decided to settle the matter by force, raising his standards for war on August 22nd, 1642.
