Hello There! I will be your guide in this Stuart Era Virtual Museum. I hope you're as excited as I am! Firstly, could you move towards me and come into the green ring below me? You are in the ring properly when the particles start floating up towards you.
Next, please point at "Who are you? and say "Tell me about this". You can point by squeezing the grip, trigger and pressing A on your right Oculus controller.
Great! Now pick it up.
