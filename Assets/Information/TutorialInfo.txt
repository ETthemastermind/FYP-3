Hello There! I will be your guide in this Stuart Era Virtual Museum. I hope you're as excited as I am! Firstly, could you move towards me and come into the green ring below me? You are in the ring properly when the particles start floating up towards you.
Next, please point at "Portraits" and say "Tell me about this". You can point by squeezing the grip, trigger and pressing A on your right Oculus controller.
Great! Now pick it up.
Now you can look at the artifact as much as you like. When youre finished looking, open your hand to drop the artifact.
Now that you can pick artifacts up, its time to learn how to get information about the artifacts. If you open your left hand, with your palm facing upwards, your guidebook will appear in your hand. With this, you can see the keywords that relate to each artifact, the artifacts name and a text version of the audio information you ask for. Give this a try and say this artifacts keyword.
