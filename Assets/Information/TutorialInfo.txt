Hello There! I will be your guide in this virtual museum, based on the James I and VI and Charles I of England and Scotland. I hope you're as excited as I am! Firstly, could you move towards me and come into the green ring below me, until you see particles floating around you. Alternatively, you can walk through the door on your left to opt out of this tutorial.
Next, please point at one of the keywords on the pedestal and say "Tell me about this".
Great! Now pick it up.
Now you can look at the artifact as much as you like. When youre finished looking, open your hand to drop the artifact.
Now that you can pick artifacts up, its time to learn how to get information about the artifacts. If hold X on your left controller, your guidebook will appear in your hand. With this, you can see the keywords that relate to each artifact, the artifacts name on the left page and a text version of the audio information you ask for on the right page. Give this a try and say one of this artifacts keywords.
Wonderful. Here you can press the buttons on the left and right of you to cycle this display. Alternativley, you can say "Cycle Left" or "Cycle Right". Give this a try.
See? Easy. Time for the last exhibit. Follow the rug to the Diorama Exhibit and stand in the blue ring.
